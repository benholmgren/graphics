# Project 1 MAZE
### By Ben Holmgren and Ryan Hansen
---
Our maze is a simple, yet elegant white with a cube as our object of interest.
The cube is controlled via wasd keys for movement in different directions, and may be switched to a first person view using the space bar. Viewing may be rotated smoothly in first person mode using the f and g keys. Collision handling was begun but not finished completely, but the front and back walls account for collisions.
The remainder of the maze works well, and other standard controls for transformations hold, though they cause first person mode to no longer be accurate. Our only other shortcoming comes with a glitch in the hardcoding of the maze triangulation, which has an error somewhere on the top rectangle of the bars within the maze which was difficult to find.

Otherwise, enjoy the simple elegance of our maze
